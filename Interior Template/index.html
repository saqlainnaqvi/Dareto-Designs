            <p>
              Our design process typically begins with an initial consultation
              to understand your vision, needs, and budget. From there, we
              create a concept and design plan that includes layout options,
              mood boards, and material selections. Once approved, we manage the
              project through to completion, coordinating all aspects of the
              design, including sourcing materials and overseeing installation,
              to ensure a smooth and stress-free experience.

            <p>
              The timeline for a design project varies depending on the scope
              and complexity. On average, a standard residential project can
              take anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks from the initial consultation to
              completion. Larger or more complex projects may take longer. We
              provide a detailed timeline during the planning phase and keep you
              updated throughout the process to ensure everything stays on
              track.
